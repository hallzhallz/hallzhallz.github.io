# Yoghurt Pancakes

I tried this [yoghurt pancakes recipe](http://www.justataste.com/fluffy-greek-yogurt-pancakes-recipe/) but I adapted it to have more yogurt so it used a whole single serve tub. It makes thick and fluffy pancakes :)

- 2 Large Eggs
- 1 Cup Greek Yoghurt (single serve tub)
- 1 Cup Milk
- 1 Cup Wholemeal Flour
- 1 Cup White Flour
- 1 Teaspoon Vanilla Essence
- 5 Teaspoons Baking Powder
- 2 Tablespoons Butter + extra for cooking
